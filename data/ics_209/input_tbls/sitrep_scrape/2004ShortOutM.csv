PER IC'S AIRCRAFT WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN STOPPING SPREAD OF FIRE INTO RESIDENTIAL AREA. Comments from Chief O'Leary:We had a close call yesterday in Escondido, 1300 hours, 10 acres, medium fuels on a 20% slope, caused by a grinder, cleared it down to nothing but dirt.  The fire jumped a two lane road, spotting 100 feet ahead of the main front, with Rh in the 60's, off shore flow had ended at 1000 hours, and it had a west wind of only 5 mph.  It would have been a much larger fire if we had not had AA, two S-2's, two helos, five crews, and five engines on it within a short period of time.  It is raining today, but evaporating quickly.  Kevin O'Leary"," ESCONDIDO CITY FIRE AND POLICE, SAN MARCOS CITY FIRE, CDF, SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF, CHP.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Gloria White,Dan Pagni,CSR OCC,Dan Pagni,2/14/04,1212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,0,,0,,,,,
